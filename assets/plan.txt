as an CAD designer in charge of ordering material for PO.
I want a web app
So that I can quickly create a PO of the neccesary amount of material needed for the project

Steel beam calculator:
given a input space for max material length
when I input a beam length
then it is saved in a array as fixed purchase length
when I choose tubing width, height, thickness
then the information is added into the array

given a input space for in stock material length
when I input a beam length
then it is saved in a different array for instock beam 
when I choose tubing width, height, thickness
then it is saved with the length array
given an input space for the needed length
when I input beam length and quantity required as set
then information is used to calculate how many tubing need to be purchased
when I press print button
then 2 excel is produced. 1 with tubing information and quanity required for purchase, other shows how each purchased tubing will be divided for the project.

pseudo code
input purchase length,width,height,thickness
then save input in array as new purchase item
input stock length,width,height,thickness
then save input as stock array.
input more stock info
then push input into stock array.
then create new array(calculate base) to push new purchase item array content into stock array.
input list of length x quantity.
then length pushed into need length array in numbers declared by quantity.
then order calculate base array to shortest to longest. use orEach to subtract stock length with items of need length, and used needed length is stored in object under the stock length. 
when the stock length can no longer be subractred by nned length,
then got to next item on calculate base and repeat process until no more item on list.
then push new purchase item onto calculate base list and repeat until all items from need length is calculated.
then calculate number of new puchase items pushed to the calculate base list to get how much new items need to be purchased.
